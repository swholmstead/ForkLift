<h2>Schematic and Gerber Files</h2>

The PCB (printed circuit board) is a standard 2 layer board.  It can be manufactured by sites like https://jlcpcb.com/.
It only costs $2 to get 5 PCBs.  That is quite the bargain.

You will need to create a free account, then click "Order Now".  There will be a button to upload the Gerber zip files.
It will automatically fill in most options once you have uploaded the file.  No changes to the options are required, but I like change these options.

* "PCB Color" defaults to Green, which is fine, but I like Black.
* "Mark on PCB" defaults to Order Number, but I like to Remove Mark, to keep the board clean.
